Other:
- Terminal Screen Glitch -> probably need to do the thing zaggy was mentioning
- GhostGirl Goodbye (have ghostgirl appear at opening of ship when it is leaving if she is not actively chasing)
- Haunted apparatus, whoever holds a stolen apparatus will now be the haunted player
- secondary interactions config -> seems to be working for the most part, will leave verification up to testers

Steps: -> function created -> added config items -> added to interactions pool -> tested interaction -> tested interaction as non-host

New Interactions:
HauntedDoor stuff (vanilla compat) -> functions created -> added config items -> added to interactions pool -> tested as host with no issues
CruiserInteractions -> functions created -> added config items -> added to interactions pool -> tested as host no issues
	Good to go: ChangeCruiserRadio, CruiserEjectDriver, CruiserUseBoost, ToggleCruiserHood, CruiserWindshield, ToggleCruiserLights, FlickerCruiserLights, PushCruiser, Open/Close Doors, GearShift
Corrupted Credits -> function created -> added config item -> added to interactions pool -> client color is green, think this is fine for now
Heavy lever -> function created -> added config item -> added to interactions pool -> prob good
Use handheld item at random -> function created -> added config item -> added to interactions pool -> works for clients
Use item (in facility) not being held at random -> function created -> added config item -> added to interactions pool -> works for clients
Corrupted Dropship, lands without purchasing anything -> function created -> added config item -> seems good
Old birds (activate/deactivate?)
Steam Valves in facility functions?
Panic (heavy screenshake/giggling/slow movement)
Broken ship door (won't close)
Corrupted Cameras/Bodycam -> Zaggy says i'll need to do this thru editor



Steps towards implementation = function created -> added config items -> added to interactions pool -> tested interaction -> tested interaction as non-host
