# Community Suggestions/Requests

- Specific compatibility events with SCP Dungeon
	- Needs some testing with the rework (update 2.0.0)
	- As-is, there is no specific built-in compatibility with this interior
	- Can expand on this compatibility once more interactions have been explored with this interior.

- Specific compatibility events with facility meltdown mod
	- WIP
	- Added compatibility with lighting events so that the meltdown effects are not hindered by ghostCodes.

~~- Maximum duration for rapidFire~~
	- Completed.

~~- Configuration option to adjust signal translator message frequency (currently tied to each custom event's frequency)~~
	- Completed.

~~- Interactions with regular doors in the facility~~
