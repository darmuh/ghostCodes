# ghostCodes by darmuh

## Description

There's a ghost in the terminal and it's sending random broadcast codes to mess with the facility!

This mod aims to add a fun little random element to the game. A "ghost" is in the terminal and it is causing all kinds of mayhem.

With Ghost Girl Enhanced Mode, this mod gives the ghost girl some interesting powers!

### **[DISCLAIMER]**
- If you have SEVERE EPILEPSY you should do one of the following: 
	- disable the following configuration option by setting it to FALSE - [rfRapidLights]
	- Raise both the following configuration options so that the lights flash slow enough not to affect your condition. - [rfRLmin] & [rfRLmax]
- This mod will now delete old & obsolete configuration options, please make sure to adjust your config following any updates.
- With the ModNetworking configuration option set to [TRUE], EVERYONE will need the mod. With the ModNetworking configuration option set to [FALSE], only the host needs this mod.
	- If ModNetworking is set to [FALSE], any config settings that rely on networking will automatically be set to [FALSE]

### The Different Modes
This Mod comes highly configurable with a variety of different modes available.

**GhostGirlEnhanced (GGE)**
- This is the main mode of this mod and requires [ModNetworking] enabled to work.
- ghost codes will be sent during active hauntings by the ghost girl.
- Various interactions can stop BOTH ghost codes and active hauntings.
- ghost codes will rapidly fire during chase sequences.
	- use [ggIgnoreCodeCount] so that codes are not counted in this mode.
- GhostGirlEnhanced Bypass List [GGEbypassList]
	- Any moon that is listed here will disable this mode in favor of the other modes.
	- Good for moons that have 0% or low odds of the ghost girl spawning.

**Insanity Mode**
- This mode is a secondary mode which will send codes in varying frquencies depending on the calculated group Insanity Level.
- Varying buffs and bonuses will be applied to the base-game insanity values as they are calculated for the group.
- As the group insanity level rises, codes will be sent at more frequent intervals.
- When group insanity levels hit maximum, codes will be sent in a rapid fire fashion (can be disabled in config).
	- The codes will continue to send in a rapidFire fashion until group sanity levels lower from the set maximum.
	- If [rapidFireCooldown] is enabled, codes will stop on a short cooldown when codes have been running for [rapidFireMaxHours].

**Base ghostCodes Mode**
- With the two modes above disabled, this is the third and final mode.
- ghost codes will be sent in intervals throughout the day.
	- Can be set to either random or set intervals based on [useRandomIntervals]
	- The intervals can be further configured in the [Set Interval Configurations] and [Random Interval Configurations] configuration sections.

### Types of ghostCodes
- The ghost sends codes through the terminal that can do the following: (all can be enabled/disabled in config file)
	- Open or Close Blast Doors
	- Cause Blast Doors to go haywire and close/shut multiple times
	- Disable Turrets
	- Cause Turrets to malfunction and go Berserk
	- Disable Mines
	- Cause Mines to suddenly combust
	- Short Circuit the breaker and cut out the facility's lights
	- Broadcast random signal translator messages
	- Open/Close/Lock/Unlock Regular Doors within the facility
	- Mess with the doors on the ship
	- Mess with the lights on the ship
	- Mess with the monitors on the ship (NETWORKING REQUIRED)
	- Shock terminal users out of the terminal (NETWORKING REQUIRED)
- With [ModNetworking] disabled, any Networking required components in the mod will be disabled and their config options updated.
- With [gcGhostGirlOnly] enabled, any config options listed in [gcGhostGirlOnlyList] will be set to disabled when GhostGirlEnhanced Mode is not active.
	- Updates every time the ship lands on a moon.
	- You may want to double check your config file at the end of a session to set it back to your preferred settings.
- ghost codes will leave it's mark on the terminal via visuals and sounds. These are configurable:
	- [enableBroadcastEffect]: when enabled, will display a code broadcastes symbol on the terminal when a code is sent.
	- [gcEnableTerminalSound]: when enabled, the terminal can play a sound when a ghost code is ran.
		- [gcTerminalSoundChance]: The chances a sound will be displayed over the terminal. 100 = every time a code is ran.
		- [gcUseGirlSounds]: Whether or not the terminal will play ghost girl sounds on the terminal when a ghost girl is present.
		- [gcUseTerminalAlarmSound]: Whether or not to use the Terminal Alarm Sound (With networking disabled, this is the only possible sound to play.)
		- *Custom sounds are a planned feature, not currently implemented.*

### Fight against the hauntings
You can combat against ghost codes by doing the following:
 - Reboot the Terminal (takes anywhere between 30 and 60 seconds)
	- Done by typing "reboot" in the terminal
	- Available in all modes.
 - Emoting
	- In Ghost Girl Enhanced mode, this will get the ghost girl to stop chasing you.
		- This is a group activity and amount of players required is based on [ggEmoteStopChasePlayers]
	- In Insanity Mode, each player emoting will lower group sanity levels by value determined in [emoteBuffNum]
 - Take a shower
	- Only effective during Ghost Girl Enhanced.
	- Wash the ghost girl mark off to stop her from chasing you.
	- Will not stop her from continuing to haunt you after your shower.

### Other things this mod does
 - Transfer Hauntings to another player. (Death Note)
	- If you are currently being haunted, you can type another player's name in the terminal to tell the ghost girl to haunt them instead.
	- Remember though, you only have so many spaces in your death note to do this - [ggDeathNoteMaxStrikes]
 - When a ghost girl starts a chase, she can trigger flipping the breaker.
	- This looks to have been an idea that was scrapped from the main game that I am patching back in.
	- Use [fixGhostGirlBreakers] to enable and [ggVanillaBreakerChance] for the odds it'll happen.
 - When [canSendMessages] is enabled, the signal translator can send random messages from the list [signalMessages]
 - When [monitorsOnShipEvent] interaction is enabled, the ship monitors will display random messages from the list [monitorMessages]

Remember: The ghost doesn't really care if it's helping or not it's just sending codes to be noticed. The more you notice it the more it likes to say hello :)
