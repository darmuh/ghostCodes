# ghostCodes by darmuh

## Description

There's a ghost in the terminal and it's sending random broadcast codes to open and close doors!

This mod aims to add a fun little random element to the game by sending random door/turret/mine codes through the terminal throughout the day. 
With this mod enabled codes will be sent at configurable intervals (whether you want it set or completely random is up to you). 
Doors will open or close depending on their initial state and turrets/mines will temporarily disable if randomly selected. 

The ghost doesn't really care if it's helping or not it's just sending codes to be noticed
